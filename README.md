CMPT 353- Data Science Assigment Two

In this exercise, I am working on developing my skills in data analysis, visualization, and handling real-world datasets using Python. The task involves analyzing Wikipedia page view data and Twitter dog rating data to uncover patterns and insights. I'm learning how to handle command-line arguments with the sys module so that my scripts can dynamically take input files. Using Pandas, I will work on manipulating data, including reading structured data into DataFrames, sorting, filtering, aligning data based on indices, and merging datasets.

Visualization is a big part of this exercise. I’ll create multi-subplot figures using Matplotlib to compare datasets effectively, plot scatterplots, and use log scales to make patterns clearer. I’ll also add informative titles and labels to make the visualizations easy to understand. Through this, I’ll explore statistical relationships like Pareto distributions and look for linear correlations between datasets.

Another part of the task involves cleaning data—using regular expressions to extract meaningful patterns and filtering out outliers to keep the analysis accurate. I’ll use scipy.stats.linregress to calculate a best-fit line for the data, helping me understand trends over time. To do this, I’ll work with datetime data, converting it to timestamps and creating scatterplots that display time-based trends.

Overall, this exercise challenges me to integrate programming, data analysis, and visualization skills. It’s teaching me how to analyze and interpret data effectively while presenting the results in a clear and meaningful way.
